# Supervised machine learning
Supervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

* Data
* Model
* Training
* Evaluating
* Inference

## Data

Data contains "Features" and "Lables"

Features are the characteristics of the data
Labels are the "Answers" to the predictions.

Let's say we want to predict the amount of rain in some regions.
The features could be the time of the year, temperature, the longitude and the latitude
While the lable is the rainfall amount.

In the training data set we always have labled data.
But in the test dataset we are going to predict the lables.


The 2 characteristics of a data set are "Size" and "Diversity"
A good dataset is data set has a large Size and high Diversity.

â€  A dataset can also be characterized by the number of its features.


## Model
In ML, a model discovers paterns and the relations between the features and lables.
And then predict the lables from the features.

## Training
For the model to accomplish its goal, it has to be trained with a labled dataset. 
Loss:  The difference between the predicted and actual values.
The model compares its predicted value with the actual value and updates its solution.
During training, we can add and remove some of those features, 
to see whether the model makes better predictions with or without it.

## Evaluating
After training, we need to evaluate the model. We do this by using a labled dataset.
But we only give the model the features and not the lables, so the model is going to predict the lables.
And then we can compare the predicted lables to the actual lables.


## Inference
The predicted lables that are created after finishing evaluating the model are called Infrences.


# Unsupervised machine learning
* Unsupervised learning is used for clustering and grouping our dataset into different categories 
For example, Suppose you had a dataset of users for an online shopping website.
If you wanted to understand the types of users that visit the site, you use unsupervised learning.
Because we want the model to cluster groups of related customers, we'd use unsupervised learning. 
After the model clustered the users, we'd create our own names for each cluster, 
for example, "discount seekers," "deal hunters," "surfers," "loyal," and "wanderers."
