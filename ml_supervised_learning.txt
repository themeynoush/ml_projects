In this file we are reviewing some key notes regarding supervised learning in ML.


Supervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

* Data
* Model
* Training
* Evaluating
* Inference

Data contains "Features" and "Lables"

Features are the characteristics of the data
Labels are the "Answers" to the predictions.

Let's say we want to predict the amount of rain in some regions.
The features could be the time of the year, temperature, the longitude and the latitude
While the lable is the rainfall amount.

In the training data set we always have labled data.
But in the test dataset we are going to predict the lables.


The 2 characteristics of a data set are "Size" and "Diversity"
A good dataset is data set has a large Size and high Diversity.

â€  A dataset can also be characterized by the number of its features.
